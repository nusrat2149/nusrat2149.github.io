    There’s a park two blocks away from my house. Havemeyer Playground: it is the center of my childhood. After the chapter of my elementary days closed,
I still go back to rummage through the feelings and find closure for an ending to my childhood. I lost touch with my elementary school friends, and 
all the reasons to go back to that park had diminished. Still, Havemeyer Playground has been a part of my New York secret for quite some time now. 

    There are no tall skyscrapers around my playground, nor are there crowds buzzing, nor are there cars honking. It’s a blissfully ordinary 
neighborhood and nothing like the traditional definition of New York. Though inside the park, it’s a world of its own. 

    There are kids riding bikes around the perimeter of the park, some playing tag, and others hide and seek. The basketball court is full of older kids 
bouncing around, dribbling away at their ball, and occasionally breaking some ankles. Music booms from a nearby car so loud you could feel the bass in 
your chest. I’m sitting on the very first swing, having a view of my New York like no one else. 

    Havemeyer Playground is a perfect mix of robust culture, but I don’t consider myself a part of that life. I slip into my own headspace and admire the 
life of the playground while blending in among everyone else. It lets me escape into my own world of reflection. 

    As the giggles of kids and the dribbling sound of the basketball drown the air, I feel comfort cradling my body. I stare off into the distance where 
my elementary school stands tall. My friends and I would stay after school for test prep and after dismissal we’d scurry across the bridge to Havemeyer 
Playground. We’d spend the afternoon on the swings or play tag. I remember us using the yellow poles near the slide to show off our flips until our tiny 
hands calloused over. I’ve fallen multiple times at that park, carrying scars on my legs till this day. It stung for a bit, but we laughed it off and 
went our own ways at the end of the day. I don’t see those same people at the playground anymore. I think to myself how today we are strangers to 
ourselves who only know one another by name, yet share some of the same history. A Q44 bus rushes past my very eyes and my trail of thought switches 
over. 

    I felt a gentle tap on my shoulder and just like that I snapped out of it. I looked over to find a kid asking me if she could use the swing. I smile, 
nod, and get up quickly. On my way out, I took a brief look around and imagined an empty playground. How miserable would that be? No music, no laughter, 
no movement, but an apocalyptic park. That eerie thought sent a shiver down my spine. There was no fun in an empty playground; nothing to physically feel 
a part of, nothing to admire, and nothing to trigger memories. This part of New York couldn’t possibly be kept a secret.
